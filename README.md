A Command Line Interface (CLI) ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with an ATM system through commands typed into a terminal or 
command prompt. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionalities:

1. Description: 

A CLI ATM is a simplified version of a physical ATM, designed for use in environments where a graphical user interface (GUI) is not available or practical. It provides basic banking 
functionalities through a text-based interface.

2. Features:

3. Purpose: The purpose of a CLI ATM is to provide basic banking functionalities in situations where a graphical interface is not feasible or available. It caters to users who are 
comfortable with text-based interactions and can be particularly useful in scenarios such as remote banking, automated systems integration, or educational purposes.

4. Implementation:

Implemented using a programming language such as typescript,node.js,inquirer and chalk. The implementation of inquirer with clear and prompts and instructions guide the users and
